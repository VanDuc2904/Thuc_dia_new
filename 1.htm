          text: "I have a dream that I work as a tour guide. So I understand that I will have to fly to other countries. In my personal opinion, airplanes are currently too cheap compared to the damage they cause to the environment, so I believe we should add taxes to airline ticket prices to make people choose to use other means of transport before they think about flying. I believe that people are also very happy when they can contribute to protecting the environment."

We really appreciate the time we spend together and we are happy to be able to meet each other and share our new story. I know that traveling by plane too much is not good for the environment so I often shop online or go to work by bike instead of going by car or I reuse plastic bags and paper bags. In addition, I sometimes volunteer to clean up trash in the neighborhood."

          speaker: "C",
          text: "I was a businessman so I had to fly many times a week. I had to go to other countries to be able to sign wine trading contracts with them. I felt very tired every time I have to fly. Now, my sister and I, whenever we have free time, take the train together and we enjoy that time very much because I can travel while sightseeing and relax without any stress."

Every time I go on a plane I feel extremely tired and I just hope time passes quickly so I can get off that plane. However, due to the specific nature of my job, I have to film in many different locations, so sometimes I cannot avoid having to take this public transportation."

But there is one thing that I want the restaurant to improve. The restaurant band played live music but it was very far away, so the sound was very low and it didn't make the meal atmosphere lively. Next time turn the music louder, please!"

However, I ordered orange juice and mango juice and they were both delicious. What about the surroundings? Lively music along with fashionable and appropriate decor makes me feel very comfortable."

As for the food, I think there's nothing to write about. I ordered fish and chips, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. But many people say that the food here is fabulous. So, I think I'm an exception."

Furthermore, the menu with traditional dishes contrasting with the modern decoration style made me feel very confused and strange. The waiters here were also not friendly. This was one of my worst experiences eating at a restaurant. "

My wife often laughs at me for doing so, but I don't mind, as long as I can finish reading so many books."

I usually don't limit myself to reading one at a time. There are so many titles I can choose from that get me excited. I have a list of books that I want to read in the future."

So, I've been reading that one book for half a year now and have only read chapter 2. However, when I read factual books, I find it very interesting and it keeps me awake for hours."

When I have free time, I usually want to read light books, like mystery novels or comedy. I often read on the train to work. I have a young child, so when I come home I almost don't have time to read. Therefore, I have to read books when traveling by train. So, a book can last me 1 week."

However, we already had the bus route and we signed up to take the bus for a full day. Buses are very cheap and very convenient. I feel very lucky to not have to put pressure on my sore feet "

In that area, there are many things that I need. There is a lot of water, a natural area, a small forest and a special camping area. I really like coming to this place to rest. It also has a great coffee serving area for visitors "

These performances often take place in front of department stores. So this prevents me from shopping inside those stores. I was very surprised when I came home with an empty bag and I didn't buy anything. "

When volunteers clean up the park, it will be clean, but it will become busy again after about a month when tourist season arrives. I think we should clean this park regularly about once a month. Surrounding areas such as the lake and local forest should also be cleaned up. We should also have signs telling visitors to clean up their trash. I am very upset when I see a lot of trash on both sides of the road."

Famous tourist destinations are the places I want to explore the most when traveling somewhere. I don't understand why many people just like to sit still at the beach when traveling, I find that uninteresting and time-consuming. "
