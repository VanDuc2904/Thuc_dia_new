In my personal opinion, airplanes are currently too cheap compared to the damage they cause to the environment, so I believe we should add taxes to airline ticket prices to make people choose to use other means of transport before they think about flying. I believe that people are also very happy when they can contribute to protecting the environment."

We really appreciate the time we spend together and we are happy to be able to meet each other and share our new story. I know that traveling by plane too much is not good for the environment so I often shop online or go to work by bike instead of going by car or I reuse plastic bags and paper bags. In addition, I sometimes volunteer to clean up trash in the neighborhood."

Every time I go on a plane I feel extremely tired and I just hope time passes quickly so I can get off that plane. However, due to the specific nature of my job, I have to film in many different locations, so sometimes I cannot avoid having to take this public transportation."

But there is one thing that I want the restaurant to improve. The restaurant band played live music but it was very far away, so the sound was very low and it didn't make the meal atmosphere lively. Next time turn the music louder, please!"

As for the food, I think there's nothing to write about. I ordered fish and chips, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. But many people say that the food here is fabulous. So, I think I'm an exception."

Furthermore, the menu with traditional dishes contrasting with the modern decoration style made me feel very confused and strange. The waiters here were also not friendly. This was one of my worst experiences eating at a restaurant. "

When I have free time, I usually want to read light books, like mystery novels or comedy. I often read on the train to work. I have a young child, so when I come home I almost don't have time to read. Therefore, I have to read books when traveling by train. So, a book can last me 1 week."

In that area, there are many things that I need. There is a lot of water, a natural area, a small forest and a special camping area. I really like coming to this place to rest.

When volunteers clean up the park, it will be clean, but it will become busy again after about a month when tourist season arrives. I think we should clean this park regularly about once a month. Surrounding areas such as the lake and local forest should also be cleaned up. We should also have signs telling visitors to clean up their trash. I am very upset when I see a lot of trash on both sides of the road."
