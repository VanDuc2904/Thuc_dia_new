Cities are already too crowded, and people don’t even have enough land for housing. How can we take land for farming and raising livestock?\nW: We could use spaces like balconies or parks for farming. These farming areas would make the city more beautiful and a better place to live. Plus, it would benefit the local economy since the city could become more self-sufficient in food production without relying on imports from other regions.\nM: I agree that farming areas would make the landscape greener and more attractive. But adding farming space won’t significantly boost the local economy. Farmers have been transporting food into cities for a long time, and we’ve never had issues with food supply or shortages.\nW: You make a good point. With limited farming space, it wouldn’t be enough to meet the food demands of city residents. We would still rely on food supplies from suburban areas.\nM: Exactly. A few small farming spaces won’t fulfill the food demand, but they would take up a lot of valuable land that could be used for housing.",
